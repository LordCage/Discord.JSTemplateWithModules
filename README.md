To learn how to add commands to the bot I recommend you to watch [An Idiot's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR2_rarYLHfg6ZJqq0WTMmI9uLcd7_GRO) on Discord.JS!<br>
Look through all the comments so you don't miss out anything!

# Configuring the bot
After you "fork" / download the files you will need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), open a command prompt in the folder of the bot (Shift + Right Click => Open command window here)<br>
After you are done with this, just do ```npm i``` in the console and it will install all the things the bot needs to use!<br>
After this things, you are ready to add commands to it!<br>
Don't forget to add in your token and the prefix in the config.json file!

Why? Because some people are lazy, that's why :)
