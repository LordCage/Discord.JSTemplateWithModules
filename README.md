# Important things

To learn how to add commands to the bot I recommend you to watch [An Idiot's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR2_rarYLHfg6ZJqq0WTMmI9uLcd7_GRO) on Discord.JS!

Look through all the comments so you don't miss out anything!

## Configuring the bot

After you "fork" / download the files you will need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), open a command prompt in the folder of the bot (Shift + Right Click => Open command window here)

After you are done with this, just do ```npm i``` in the console and it will install all the things the bot needs to use!

After this things, you are ready to add commands to it!

**Don't forget to add in your token, prefix, and owner ID in the config.json file!**

Why? Because some people are lazy, that's why :)


Note: Some of the code was inspired by [York](https://github.com/YorkAARGH), the idiot himself. Show some support :)
